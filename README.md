An accuracy of 0.0881 is relatively low and may indicate that VGG16 is not performing well on this particular task. It could be due to various reasons such as model architecture, insufficient data, or inappropriate hyperparameters.
It appears there might be a misunderstanding in your statement. Typically, a low accuracy suggests that a model is not effective in discriminating between different classes, while a high accuracy indicates the opposite. In your provided information, the reported accuracy for VGG16 is 0.0881, which is indeed low, suggesting that VGG16 may not be performing well on the task of discriminating between different types of bone marrow aspiration cells associated with Myelodysplastic Syndromes.To improve the VGG16 model's performance, you may want to experiment with the aforementioned factors and conduct a thorough analysis of the data and training process. Additionally, comparing the architecture and parameters of VGG16  is performing significantly better in this specific application.
